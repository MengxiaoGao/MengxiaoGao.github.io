## About Me

I am a first-year PhD student in the [School of Operations Research and Information Engineering (ORIE)](https://www.orie.cornell.edu/) at Cornell University. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Kyra Gan](https://kyra-gan.github.io/). My research focuses on developing robust and efficient methods for causal inference and causal discovery. I am also working on developing efficient and scalable nonparametric statistical tests.

Before my PhD, I received my B.S. from [Weiyang College](https://www.wyc.tsinghua.edu.cn/), Tsinghua University, where I pursued a dual major in Mathematics & Physics and Civil Engineering & Systems.

I am always happy to chat — feel free to reach out via email!

## Miscellaneous

Outside of research, I enjoy puzzle-solving games and follow tennis and figure skating. I have a deep appreciation for traditional Chinese music and classical poetry. I also love traveling and trying local cuisines wherever I go.

My favorite figure skating programs includes:
