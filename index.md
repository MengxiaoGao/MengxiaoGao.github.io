<h2><div id="about">About Me</div></h2>

I am currently a junior student at Weiyang College, Tsinghua University, pursuing a dual major in Mathematics and Physics, as well as Civil Engineering and Systems.

In addition to my undergraduate coursework, I am fortunate to be mentored by Professor  [Kyra Gan](https://kyra-gan.github.io/), with whom I explore local discovery and hybrid global causal discovery with local search strategies. My research primarily centers on devising robust and efficient inference and causal discovery methods. More broadly, I am captivated by the challenge of constructing abstract mathematical models to address real-world problems and applying interpretable statistical techniques to data from physics, biology, social sciences, and engineering.

I am always open to engaging in discussions or forging new friendships. Please feel free to reach out to me via email if you share similar interests or simply wish to connect.

<h2><div id="other">Miscellaneous</div></h2>
I am very fond of puzzle-solving games. I enjoy watching and following tennis and figure skating. I have a deep appreciation for traditional Chinese music and classical poetry. While I am not particularly keen on sports, I greatly enjoy traveling and savoring local cuisines.
